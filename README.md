# Titanic-Survival

Predicting Survival: The core goal is to "predict the survival of the passengers." This is a classic classification problem in machine learning. Classification involves building a model that can categorize data into distinct classes (in this case, "survived" or "did not survive").   

Data Analysis and Preprocessing: The first two sections (Data Analysis and Data Cleaning) are crucial steps in any machine learning workflow.   

Data Analysis: Understanding the data's structure, types, and quality is essential for building effective models.   
Data Cleaning: Machine learning models typically require clean and consistent data. Handling missing values and converting categorical features to numerical ones are standard preprocessing tasks.   
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is vital for gaining insights into the data and identifying patterns that may be relevant for prediction. In this context, EDA helps understand which features are most strongly associated with survival.   

Model Building (Implied): While the document doesn't explicitly state "build a model," the objective of "predicting survival" implies that a model will be trained. The data cleaning and EDA steps are preparing the data for this.   

In summary:

This test is designed to evaluate  to perform  machine learning project, from data preparation to analysis and prediction.
